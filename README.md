# **Fruit Classification Prediction Model using Logistic Regression** 
Project by: Rahul Oberoi and Vishal Singh

This study presents an analysis of various machine 
learning models for fruit classification. A dataset was provided 
that consisted of multiple features with their corresponding 
labels. The models that were tested included K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and 
Logistic Regression. The accuracy of the models was evaluated 
by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels in the 
test dataset. The results showed that Logistic Regression had 
the highest accuracy for fruit classification. Further optimization 
of the Logistic Regression model was carried out using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis 
(LDA), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and K-Means clustering 
techniques. The hyperparameters of the model were tuned using 
Grid Search Cross Validation to achieve better results. Overall, 
the study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning 
models in accurately classifying fruits based on their features.
